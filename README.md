# The Modern Witcher

### Milestone Project 4: Fullstack Frameworks

![demo](https://github.com/synnea/the-modern-witcher/blob/master/media/design/demo.JPG).

[The Modern Witcher](https://the-modern-witcher.herokuapp.com/) was designed, built and deployed by Carina PÃ¶ll as the final project of her diploma in software development. It is an E-Commerce website aimed at fans of the Witcher franchise. Through it, fans can purchase goods that replicate items that exist within the world of the The Witcher novels and video games.

The Witcher copyright is held by Andrzej Sapkowski. No copyright infringement is intended with this website created for educational purposes only, and no money is being made through The Modern Witcher.

The project utilizes Python 3, Django 2.2, JavaScript, and various other frameworks and libraries. Full CRUD functionality is offered throughout features of the project.

## UX <a name="UX"></a>

The Modern Witcher's target audience are fans of the The Witcher franchise. In keeping with the target audience, some elements from the game were taken. For example, the product descriptions and even the error messages contain phrases familiar to people who have played the series of the The Witcher RPGs. Visually, a webfont was used to mimic the official The Witcher font.

The main hero image featured on the Modern Witcher features just that: a modern witcher in modern clothes. This image served as the starting point for design considerations, and orange became the defining color of the website.

Overall, the UX design is in line with common e-commerce conventions. The index and shop pages are accessible to the public. To view the account and cart areas, users need to be registered and logged in.

The design features a static navbar which is transparent and appears upon scroll for desktop users on the index page. The navbar and footer elements are not visible in the checkout area to keep consistent with other e-commerce platforms.

FontAwesome icons are provided throughout the website to aid intuitive information input.

### User Stories <a name="userstories"></a>

The following user stories were used to design the website:

- I am a fan of the The Witcher franchise, and I'm specifically interested in buying merchandise.
- I am a fan of the The Witcher franchise, but I'm not specifically interested in buying merchandise.
- I am not a particular fan of the The Witcher franchise, but I am interested in buying unique gifts.
- I want to have an enjoyable online shopping experience.


### Wireframes <a name="wireframes"></a>

Extensive wireframes for both desktop and mobile versions were created with Balsamiq for the project. As an example, here is a wireframe for the index page:

![index-wire](https://github.com/synnea/the-modern-witcher/blob/master/media/design/example-wf.JPG)


The wireframes for every page on the website are available in .pdf format on this github respository: [WIREFRAME](https://github.com/synnea/the-modern-witcher/tree/master/wireframes).

A color palette was created early on, using the colors found in the background image as the basic point of reference. The palette was created using https://coolors.co/. The decision was taken early on that the website would feature a color scheme focused on shades of orange and purple.

The following screenshot features most of the colors used throughout the project:

![COLOR PALETTE](https://github.com/synnea/the-modern-witcher/blob/master/media/design/color_palette.JPG).

For the most part, the wireframes are similar to the finished product. However, some features were taken out due to time restraints and/or practical design concerns. One example is the 'related products' feature, which took page real estate from the review function, and which didn't seem particularly helpful due to the low number of the overall items. Since each category currently holds only about 2 items each, the database currently doesn't hold enough items to make meaningful recommendations.

## Data <a name="data"></a>

### Items <a name="items"></a>

The Modern Witcher is backed by a PostgreSQL database. At the time of writing, there are 7 items in the database.

All item photos were taken from popular shops such as Etsy. Links to the sources of each individual item can be found in the Credits section of this README file.
 

### Models <a name="models"></a>

The Witcher supports full CRUD functionality with its models.

The custom models created for the database are: Profile, Review, Item, Order, and OrderLineItem.

The 'Profile' model saves the users address and displays it in the Account section of the website. It also automatically renders the pre-saved address to the checkout area.

The 'Review' model uses the User and Item as foreign key. When a user has purchased an item, the option to leave a review gets unlocked.

The 'Item' model represents the items which can be bought on The Modern Witcher. 

'Order' and 'OrderLineItem' keep track of the overall orders and the individual items contained therein, respectively. 

The Modern Witcher does not use a 'Cart' model. Instead, the contents of the cart are made available through a global context.

## Features <a name="features"></a>

### Current Features <a name="current-features"></a>

#### Feature 1 - Save Address & view past orders
Users have the option to save their address for future use in the 'Account' section of the website. It is also automatically rendered to checkout. Past orders are also displayed in the same section.

#### Feature 2 - Review Purchased Items
Once an item has been purchased, a review can be left for it. Prompts to leave a review are provided in the confirmation screen after purchase as well as in the 'account' view.

#### Feature 3 - Flexible Navbar design
On the index page, the navbar is transparent and pops into view upon scroll. On the other pages, the navbar fixed. In the checkout pages, the navbar and footer are hidden altogether.

#### Feature 4 - Toggle Items by Category
In the shop section of the website, items can be filtered by category by clicking on the corresponding category button. 

#### Feature 5 - Item Detail View
Each item features a separate, more detailed view after having been selected from the main shop or index views.



### Features Left to Implement <a name="future-features"></a>

#### Password Resetting 
Currently, there is no way for passwords to be reset. This is a feature that I would like to implement in future releases of this project.

#### Favoriting
The option to favorite items and save them in a 'my favorites' area of the account view is also a feature that is missing and which would add a lot of value to the website's UX.

## Testing <a name="testing"></a>

### Responsiveness Testing <a name="responsiveness-testing"></a>

The responsiveness of the website was tested on Responsinator.

* iPhone eXpensive portrait
* iPhone eXpensive landscape
* Android portrait
* Android landscape
* iPhone 6-8 portrait
* iPhone 6-8 landscape
* iPhone 6-8 Plump landscape
* iPhone 6-8 Plump landscape
* iPad portrait
* iPad landscape

The project is not optimized for all of the above. Landscapes and iPad versions in particular are not optimized.

Since this project's focus is on the design of the backend, I chose not to spend as much time as I did previously on strict responsiveness optimization. 

### Code Testing <a name="code-testing"></a>

**HTML** 
* [HTML Validator](https://www.freeformatter.com/html-validator.html).
    - The project contains a total of 12 html files. Throughout all of them, the HTML Validator did not recognize templating language, such as variable interpolation and functions, as valid HTML, and threw errors. This was ignored throughout all files. The following anomalies remain:
        - in the item_details.html file, the validator warns that it is not allowed to nest an h4 inside of a button. I chose to keep it anyway as the button is still fully functional.
        - for the navbar.html file, the validator warns that a label should not appear as a descendant of the a element. I chose to keep it in for similar reasons as the one above.


**CSS**  
* [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).
    - The project contains 1 CSS file (along with several SCSS ones). The file passes validation without any errors.

**JavaScript** 
* [JSHint.com](https://jshint.com/). 
    - The project contains 4 JavaScript files. All of them are semantically correct.

**Python**
* [PEP8Online](http://pep8online.com/).
    - The project contains numerous Python files, some generated by Django and a dozen files I authorted myself. At the time of writing this readme, the Python code in this project contains a total of 10 lines which exceed the recommended max length of 79 characters. I chose to leave them in because breaking them up resulted in less readability. The PEP8 guide states that its guidelines could be bent on an individual basis when doing so raised readability, hence I chose to do so here. Apart from those 10 lines, the code is fully PEP8-compliant.

### User Story Testing <a name="user-stories-testing"></a>

Here are the results for the user story tests:

**Story 1**

- I am a fan of the The Witcher franchise, and I'm specifically interested in buying merchandise.

Solution: upon landing on the main page, the characteristic font and background image immediately tell the user that they are on a website that is related to The Witcher franchise. The slogan makes clear that it's a merchandise website. A click on the prominently-displayed 'shop now' button leads them to the shop view.


**Story 2**

- I am a fan of the The Witcher franchise, but I'm not specifically interested in buying merchandise.

Solution: upon landing on the main page, the characteristic font and background image immediately tell the user that they are on a website that is related to The Witcher franchise. Since they aren't here to buy merchandise, it might not be clear to them that this is what the website is about, but the background image is interesting enough that they want to find out more about it. Scrolling down to the 'about' section, they discover that they are on a merchandise e-commerce shop. Out of curiosity, they proceed to the shop view by clicking on the main call-to-action button.

**Story 3**

- I am not a particular fan of the The Witcher franchise, but I am interested in buying unique gifts.

Solution: upon landing on the main page, the user does not immediatelz recognize the character of Geralt of Rivia in the background, nor the characteristic font. However, the navbar, which is typical for e-commerce platforms, makes it clear that this is a website on which the user can buy things. 

Scrolling down, the user sees the recommended items on the front page to get an idea about the sort of items that they can purchase. The sort of items (armor, swords) makes it clear that unique gifts can be bought here.

Upon clicking on one of the recommended items, the user can see reviews as well as more general information about the items, such as measurements and weight.

**Story 4**

- I want to have an enjoyable online shopping experience.

Solution: The Modern Witcher adheres to e-commerce standards. The navbar contains the elements that a user would expect from an e-commerce website. The navbar contains familiar icons, and the checkout area follows e-commerce convention of illustrating the user journey and hiding the navbar and footer elements.

The user area offers the option to save the address for future use.


## Deployment <a name="deployment"></a>

### Deployment Writeup <a name="deployment-writeup"></a>
 
To deploy The Modern Witcher on heroku, I took the following steps:

1. I created a requirements.txt file using the terminal command pip freeze > requirements.txt.

2. I created a Procfile with the terminal command echo web: python app.py > Procfile.

3. I staged and committed the requirements.txt and Procfile to my project repository. 

4. I went to heroku.com, logged in, and clicked on the "New" button in the dashboard to create a new app. I named it 'the-modern-witcher' and set its region to Europe.

5. In the heroku dashboard for the application, I clicked on "Settings" > "Reveal Config Vars". Then, I set the Port, IP, PostgreSQL and Secret Key variables.

6. From my terminal window, I logged into heroku using "heroku login --interactive." After entering my credentials, I registered heroku as a remote destination for my project with "heroku git remote." I then pushed my project to heroku with "git push heroku."

7. To get the app to run and scale the dynos, I used the command "heroku ps:scale web=1" in my terminal.

8. The app is now successfully deployed!

### Differences between local and deployed versions <a name="deployment-differences"></a>

The project was developed locally with Visual Studio Code. Environment variables, including secret key and PostgreSQL URLs, were saved in a settings.json file which was added to .gitignore. For the deployed version, as mentioned in the deployment writeup above, environemnt variables were set in the Config Variables.
